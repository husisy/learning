9. Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)
   * graph partition problem
10. completely positive (CP) trace-preserving: unitary
11. `optimization_level`
    * `0`: maps the circuit to the backend, with no explicit optimization (except whatever optimizations the mapper does)
    * `1`: maps the circuit, but also does light-weight optimizations by collapsing adjacent gates
    * `2`: including a noise-adaptive layout and a gate-cancellation procedure based on gate commutation relationships
    * `3`: including resynthesis of two-qubit blocks of gates in the circuit
